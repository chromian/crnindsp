# crnindsp

A Python toolbox for the identification of indicator species in a chemical reaction network.

## Overview

`crnindsp` is a Python module designed to analyze chemical reaction networks (CRNs) and identify indicator species—key species that provide insights into the multistability behavior the network—purely based on two structural information:

- Stoichiometry information
- Qualitative regulatory information

This toolbox is useful for researchers and scientists working in systems chemistry, computational biology, or related fields.

## Installation

You can install `crnindsp` directly from GitHub using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/chromian/crnindsp.git
```
